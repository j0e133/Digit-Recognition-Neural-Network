# Digit-Recognition-Neural-Network

This is my 4-H Digit recognition neural network

To try it out:

install pygame 3.11
install pygame (type pip install pygame in the terminal)
download the files

run main.py to see the network's capabilities
or
run train.py to train the network even more (may be very slow)
