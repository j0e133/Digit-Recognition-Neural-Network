# Digit-Recognition-Neural-Network

This is my 4-H Digit recognition neural network

To try it out:

install pygame 3.11

install pygame (type pip install pygame in the terminal)

download the files from this repository

To run the ai:

run main.py to see the network's guesses and press space to switch between images OR run train.py to train the network even more (may be very slow)
